# Useful SPARQL

Some Wikidata SPARQL queries I've used in the past that, though surprisingly useful, were not that simple to build!

## Run the website

- Download dependencies

```sh
npm init
```

- Build website

```sh
node index.js
```

- Serve the website by opening the \_site directory on your web browser
  or with tools like [python3 http.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html?highlight=http%20server#module-http.server)
  or npm's [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server)
